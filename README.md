# SAP Support Message Reporting

Replicate data from SAP Support Launchpad Incident Management OData service for local reporting.

## Architecture

## Current functionality

Currently two visualizations are implemented. An Overview Page:

and an Analytical List Page:

## TODO

- [x] Load data from mock
- [x] Load data SAP Service Marketplace
- [x] Docker Image
- [ ] Add reporting for the event log (MessageAlogSet)
- [x] Find a user friendly way to maintain the Authentication Cookie. Using the SAP Passport (X.509 Client Certificate) would be a good option. Here [using SSL Certificate with Axios](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51363855/how-to-configure-axios-to-use-ssl-certificate) might help.
- [ ] Deploy to SAP HANA Cloud & SAP BTP Cloud Foundry
- [ ] Expose Data to SAP Analytics Cloud
- [ ] Implement further reports in SAP Analytics Cloud

## Start the project with sample data

To run the project with sample data you can directly use `npm start`.

## Load Data from SAP Service Marketplace

### Getting Cookie using SAP Passport Certificate

To load data from OSS add the following content to the _default-env.json_ file in the root folder:

```JSON
{
  "VCAP_SERVICES": {},
  "destinations": [
    {
      "destination": "OSS",
      "url": "https://launchpad.support.sap.com",
      "credentials": {}
    }
  ],
  "OSS_COOKIE": {
    "cookie": "<Your Cookie>"
  }
}
```

you can now replace `<Your Cookie>` with the content of [your cookie that you've got from your browser](#update-mock-data-with-your-own-incidents). The other option is to use the SAP Passport (X.509 Client Certificate). At https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/sappassport all S-Users can get their SAP Passport and install it into their local certificate store to Single Sign On (SSO) to the SAP Service Marketplace. [With this steps](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSVP8U_9.7.0/com.ibm.drlive.doc/topics/r_extratsslcert.html) the resulting PFX file can be prepared to be used with curl and NodeJS:

```
openssl pkcs12 -in s-user.pfx -nocerts -out s-user.key
openssl pkcs12 -in s-user.pfx -clcerts -nokeys -out s-user.crt
openssl rsa -in s-user.key -out s-user-decrypted.key
```

Then run `npm run cookie:update` to update the cookie in _default-env.json_.

Then start the project with `npm start` and execute the _loadDataFromSAP_ request in the _test/cap-endpoint.http_ file.

### Getting Cookie using the browser developer tools

If you want to update the mock date in the srv/data folder with your own SAP Incidents, then open your Browser, activate the Development tools, switch to the network tab and then open the URL:

https://launchpad.support.sap.com/services/odata/incidentws/?$format=json

You need to login with your SAP User. Open the details of the request and look for the Request Headers:

![Cookie](assets/cookies.png)

You find the Cookies. Copy the content of the Cookies header and add it's content to a file named .env in the test folder. The Content should look like that:

```
cookie="JTENANTSESSIONID_supportportal...."
```

When you've done that make sure that you've opened this project in VS Code and the [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) is installed. Open the test/get-data-from-sap.http file and execute the first two requests. With the result you can fill the corresponding files in the srv/data folder. To protect the privacy only specific columns are selected. If you comment the lines starting with _&$select=_ with a # you will get all data.

## Run from Docker image

First time start:

```
docker run --name sap-support-message-reporting -i -p 4004:4004 gregorwolf/sap-support-message-reporting:latest
```

[Load Data from Mock Service](#load-data-from-mock-service)

Then open http://localhost:4004 in the browser.

Stop:

```
docker stop sap-support-message-reporting
```

Start:

```
docker start -i sap-support-message-reporting
```

Remove:

```
docker rm sap-support-message-reporting
```

## Deploy to Kyma

Download the kubeconfig from your Kyma instance via the menu behind the account Icon in the upper right corner. Save it in _~/.kube/kubeconfig-kyma.yml_. Then run:

```
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/kubeconfig-kyma.yml
```

Please note that the token in the kubeconfig is [only valid for 8 hours](https://kyma-project.io/docs/components/security#details-iam-kubeconfig-service). So you might have to redo the download whenever you want to run the commands again.

To keep this project separate from your other deployments I would suggest to create a namespace:

```
kubectl create namespace sap-support-message-reporting
```

Deploy the configuration:

```
kubectl -n sap-support-message-reporting apply -f kyma/deployment.yaml
```

Update the container:

```
kubectl -n sap-support-message-reporting rollout restart deployment/sap-support-message-reporting
```

If you want to delete the deployment, then run:

```
kubectl -n sap-support-message-reporting delete -f kyma/deployment.yaml
```
